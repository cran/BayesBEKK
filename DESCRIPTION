Description: The Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (MGARCH) models are used for modelling the volatile multivariate data sets. In this package a variant of MGARCH called BEKK (Baba, Engle, Kraft, Kroner) proposed by Engle and Kroner (1995) <http://www.jstor.org/stable/3532933> has been used to estimate the bivariate time series data using Bayesian technique.
